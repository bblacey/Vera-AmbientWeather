# Vera-AmbientWeather
Vera MIOS Plugin for Ambient Weather Stations

# Overview

This plugin will retrieve the external and internal humidity and temperature
from Ambient Weather 1200/1400 IP weather stations.  It also computes the 
moving average for each sensor reading which is useful to smooth spikes
that normally would cause false positives for scene triggers
